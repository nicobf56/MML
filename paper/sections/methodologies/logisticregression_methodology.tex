\subsubsection{Logistic Regression Methodology}
To evaluate logistic regression, we first loaded the model and used the balanced dataset to compute the mean embedding of each text input. The model was then trained using these representations. The data was split into 80\% for training and 20\% for testing, and the corresponding evaluation metrics were generated.
