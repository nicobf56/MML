\subsubsection{Naive Bayes Methodology}
\label{sec:nb}

Naive Bayes classifier was implemented using token level features to derive from TF-IDF representation with the use of the raw tweets. The process began by preprocessing the tweets where low information-tokens, such as stopwords or single character artifacts were eliminated to reduce noise in space. Then a TF-IDF vectorizer was used to transform clean text into feature factors to help highlight discriminative terms. The the model was trained to estimate the probability based on word frequency counts. Finally, the classifiers performance was evaluated using precision, recall, and f1-score.
