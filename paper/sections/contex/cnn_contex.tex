\subsubsection{Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)}
In the reviewed studies~\cite{bonetti2023comparison,fieri2023offensive}, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been employed as an efficient deep learning approach for the detection of offensive language and toxic comments. Their ability to extract spatial patterns from text embeddings enables the identification of relevant structures within input sequences, leading to effective classification. However, although CNNs exhibit competitive performance, the studies also emphasize that their effectiveness may be surpassed by models capable of capturing full-sequence context, such as bidirectional recurrent neural networks or transformer-based models, particularly when dealing with complex or ambiguous natural language inputs.
