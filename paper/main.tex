\begin{abstract}
The following article presents a study on detection of hate speech in social networks with a specific focus on Twitter's platform. The problem has been present in digital communication and has had a high social and economic impact on these platforms. Methodologies are proposed with different techniques that include Machine Learning and Deep Learning applications to a balanced data frame through an extensive data pre-processing. The compared models include Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, XGBoost,SVM and deep architecture such as CNN, LSTM, BI-LSTM and GRU. Other approaches with transformers, such as RoBERTa where explored to evaluate performance in tweet classification. The results show that deep learning models have a greater impact in accuracy increase, where models such as BI-LSTM, GRU and RoBERTa take over.
